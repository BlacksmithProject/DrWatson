# BlacksmithProject - DrWatson

A PHP library enhancing `\Exception`.

## Why ?

`\Exception` does not provide enough information to debug easily.

Indeed, stacktrace can sometime be hard to understand, and message
can be insufficient.

`DrWatson` is the developper personal investigation assistant, providing
type, suspect and help.
